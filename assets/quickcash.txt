LOGO:

the main goal was to simplify the shape, and turn it more clear and modern. I choose a sans serif and geometric font, not just because of the visual, but there's a practical aspect. today people are using smartphones more and more, and when we have a complex shape, or font, it get hard to read in a small screen. So, that's the reason to change de logo, to make it readable in most screens sizes.

I know it's hard to chage ir so quickly, but I think it's something for the quickcash team to consider. To have a new brand and a strategy to change the logo foward.

PICTURES:
These pictures are from random websites, we really can't use them. But it shows to us a way. The ideal is the quickcash to have its own pictures. These are only examples. 

LIVE ASSISTANTE:
I think it's too complex for the time we have to produce the website. Maybe we can find another alternative.

PRODUCTS PAGE:
I'll work on a new page only for to products

ABOUT US PAGE:
Also, work on a page to the informations about the company, values and news. 

give more prominence to partners.
